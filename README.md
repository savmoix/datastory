# MoneyMoves Tweets -- Data Analysis

## Data Scope
Little Big Data is simultaneously limiting and expansive, specific and general, as well as micro and macro. I found this out while conducting a twarc search and analyzing a set of 901 tweet results. The data set I collected emerged around the popular hashtag that began circulating after female rapper “Cardi B” dropped her debut single record, “Bodak Yellow (Money Moves),” in fall 2017. The song is about Cardi B’s rise to mainstream hip hop fame and personal success after growing up impoverished and turning to “dancing” in order to make ends meet. The chorus repeats “I don’t dance now / I make money moves,” referencing her newfound and hard-earned lucrativeness in the music sphere rather than in adult entertainment. The tag – “#moneymoves” – has taken on many meanings related to the song’s themes of female self-reliance and monetary success. As can be seen from the collected tweets, the hashtag is also associated with savvy financial investments and stability, “get rich quick” and other pyramid schemes, fashion, black empowerment, etc. I chose to look into this particular data set due to my own spoken usage of #moneymoves when referencing my own financial strides and self-improvements. I wanted to see how my oft-cited phrase manifested and adapted online, already anticipating a variety in thematic usages based on my own millennial friend groups.

Cardi B is often criticized for what some might perceive to be violent, foul, and anti-feminist lyrics. In “Bodak Yellow,” she raps, “Little Bitch, you can’t fuck with me, if you wanted to,” referencing her rise in social and economic standings here and later noting that she can afford luxuries such as expensive shoes. In terms of a data story, I wanted to show how Cardi B’s lyrical boasts and confidence could lend themselves to those in need of motivation, courage, and female empowerment in their everyday lives. I wanted to see tweets from underrepresented groups of people celebrating personal successes and financial stability. 

## Process
First, I was interested in gathering and comparing how #moneymoves was invoked on Twitter immediately following Billboard Hot 100’s featuring of “Bodak Yellow (Money Moves)” (7/27/17) and its invocations in the last couple of days (as of 5/7/18). I wanted to see if I could note a clear transition from tweets about music/Cardi B to others more broadly speaking to black female empowerment and self-sufficiency. After running the twarc search and downloading my data in a .csv file, I quickly realized that I would not be able to capture ALL of that data (and I am so glad that was the case). Instead, I ended up with a little over 900 tweets that featured #moneymoves. In the grand scheme, I wanted to calculate the frequency with which particular accompanying hashtags were used in conjunction with #moneymoves; however, I also wanted to date them. My main issue in pursuing this kind of inquiry was that many tweets contained long strings of accompanying tweets that, yes, I could separate by spaces/commas/etc., but they could not be constructed in a pivot table and/or visually rendered. I soon after switched gears.

Next, I decided to pay close attention to #moneymoves’ accompanying hashtags and attempt to categorize them. I realized would have to be shrewd with time spent analyzing each tweet, as well as selective in how I would “tag” them given the volume of tweets and time constraints. I created these categories as I went, that way I would be open to the messages and themes of the tweets rather than attempting to predict categories and force the data to fit them. Though, I will readily admit that I expected there to be tweets within my data set that were similar in theme to my own colloquial usages of #moneymoves. Scanning my .csv file, I created a “Tag” column and brainstormed broad categories in which to tweets could be organized. I first looked to the accompanying #hashtags for context and then moved to each tweet’s line of text in order to gain a fuller sense of the user’s motivations and message. 

The tags I found to be relevant and represented by at least two tweets in number were (in order of overall frequency): 

Promotional / “Get Rich Quick”; Motivation; Miscellaneous; Financial Security; Education; Sports; Cardi B Mentions; Fashion; Relationships; Adult Entertainment; Crypto-currency; Environmental; Celebrity; Music; Political; Religious; Black Empowerment; Equal Pay; Racial Disparity

While I could have assigned other categories – further breaking down “Motivation” or “Promotional” tweets – I found that the large volume of tweets and my desire to aptly categorize as best I could slowed down my progress. I was surprised to find that overt references to black empowerment and racial disparity via accompanying hashtags (for example: #blackgirlmagic / #blackentrepeneur / #race) were not as frequent as I expected them to be. I will speak more about this in the following section.

## Ethical Implications
I had a host of troublesome moments working through this data, one being my own position of power and the risk of what Noble calls “technological redlining.” In my attempts to remain “open” to and “transparent” in my handling of the data (my version of the language of advocacy we’ve been discussing in class), I found that I was broadly categorizing the achievements, concerns, and woes of real people. Not only was I marking certain tweets as promotional schemes/robots without a blink of the eye, but I was marking complicated/more nuanced tweets as “miscellaneous,” in the essence of time and attention. If the tweets (and users represented by said tweets) did not fit an obvious narrative or contain a variation of one of my tags I was in the process of developing, I cast them aside. I cannot imagine doing this to a live person. Not realizing it, I favored particular data and particular users (those I could easily “read” and for whom I could create marketable/categorical hashtags and phrases). 

I also found myself incredibly saddened by the realization that so many Twitter trolls and bots (aka, “Promotional/Get Rich Quick”) target online users interested in financial betterment and steadiness. This tagged group, filled with repetitive and enticing tweets from lotteries, pyramid scheme organizations, and individuals posing as wealthy benefactors, dominated my data findings. Another line of inquiry I would have liked to follow up with would center around these tweets and the number of minority Twitter users who retweeted them in order to win a sweepstakes or pursue other avenues of potential wealth, somewhat reminiscent of African American communities and targeted marketing practices of payday lenders. But, that’s the thing with data. There’s so much to unpack and so many people who go (un)seen.
